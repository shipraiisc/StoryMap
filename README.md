Trees are more than just part of the landscape; they are the lungs of our cities. With every breath we take, we rely on the natural oxygen cycle, where trees play a critical role. But as Toronto grows, its urban canopy faces increasing pressure from development, climate change, and population density.

To answer this question, I mapped the distribution of trees across Toronto and compared it with the cityâ€™s population. The results offer a striking perspective on whether our urban forest is keeping pace with our needs.
